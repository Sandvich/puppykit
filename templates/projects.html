<h1>Info about my projects</h1>
<p>
    Below is information about a number of projects that I've worked on.
</p>

<h2>Gaming</h2>
<h3><a href="https://longestegg.itch.io/ghost">Ghost</a></h3>
<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/62584?dark=true" width="552" height="167"></iframe>
<p><a href="https://github.com/avivbeeri/GameJam">Source code</a></p>
<p>
    We'd like to keep working on this, but for now the LowRezJam release is where we're leaving it. We may pick it up
    again one day.
</p>

<h3><a href="/projects/packmates/">Packmates</a></h3>
<p>
    A planned board game about wolves. Competitive co-op. Still in the early conceptual stages.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://ttio.itch.io/physsim">PhysSim</a></h3>
<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/105887?dark=true" width="552" height="167"></iframe>
<p>
    This was a project to help me learn how to use the Godot engine. I'm not going to be adding any more to this.
</p>

<h3><a href="/projects/marked_for_death">Marked For Death</a></h3>
<p>
    A Fate module written by myself and published by Shades of Vengeance. There was more I was planning to do with this,
    but I don't like the system anymore. I think I made it too complex. I'm quite proud of the campaign and universe I
    wrote though, so if you're interested, check it out!
</p>

<h3><a href="https://ttio.itch.io/smuggling-run/">Smuggling Run</a></h3>
<iframe src="https://itch.io/embed/300300?dark=true" width="552" height="167" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>
    A relatively simple game made in 48h for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2018">GMTK Game Jam 2018</a>. The
    theme was "GENRE, but you canâ€™t MECHANIC" - so I made a shmup where you can't shoot.
</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>
    <h3><a href="/">PuppyKit</a></h3>
<p>
    This website! See my homepage for more details.
</p>

<h3><a href="/projects/elcm/">ELCM</a></h3>
<p>
    A collaborative project for managing living campaigns. Started with Erica and Aksu for Shadownet, we intended from
    the beginning for the project to encompass multiple systems.
</p>

<h3><a href="/projects/empyrean">Empyrean Traits</a></h3>
<p>
    A small tool to help players of the game Mystic Empyrean look up traits. This may eventually change into a QT/C++
    program to increase portability, and possibly an android app. For now though, this is it.
