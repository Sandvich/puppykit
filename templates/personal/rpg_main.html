    Because I'm strange, I made a list of every tabletop RPG I own. You can use the page below to query my database :)

<p>
    Special pages that you might want to look at:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/personal/rpgs/all/">All games in my collection</a></li>
    <li><a href="/personal/rpgs/run/">Games that I want to run in the near future</a></li>
</ul>
