<h1>Puppykit!</h1>

<p>
    There are three main parts to me:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gaming
    <li>Nerdiness
    <li>Gender
</ul>
<p>
    A bunch of these things will, of course, spill over onto other pages, but an introduction is below.
</p>

<h2>Gaming</h2>
<p>
    I'm a gamer, both video and tabletop.
</p>

<h2>Nerdiness</h2>
<p>
    I am a massive nerd, both in computing and general nerd culture.
</p>

<h2>Gender</h2>
<p>
    I identify as genderfluid and non-binary. This means that how much of me is male and how much is female varies over
    time, and I never identify fully as either male or female. I strongly prefer that people use gender-neutral
    pronouns when referring to me.
</p>

<p>
    In the above graph, the line represents how male I am. 100% is fully male, and 0% is fully female.
