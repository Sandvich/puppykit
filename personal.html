<h1>Puppykit!</h1>
<p>There are four main parts to me:</p><ul>
<li>Gaming
<li>Nerdiness
<li>Gender
<li>Furry</ul>
<p>A bunch of these things will, of course, spill over onto other pages, but an introduction is below.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>I'm a gamer, both video and tabletop.</p>
<h3>Nerdiness</h3>
<p>I am a massive nerd, both in computing and general nerd culture.</p>
<h3>Gender</h3>
<p>I identify as genderfluid and non-binary. This means that how much of me is male and how much is female varies over time, and I never identify fully as either male or female.</p>
<img src="img/genderfluid.png" alt="Gender graph">
<p>In the above graph, the line represents how male I am. 100% is fully male, and 0% is fully female.</p>
<h3>Furry</h3>
<p>I am both furry and therian. My primary fursona is a male wolf pup called Scree, and my secondary is a female kitten known as Sam. These two broadly align to my gender (see above).</p>
