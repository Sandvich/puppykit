<h1>Puppykit!</h1>

<p>
    There are three main parts to me:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gaming
    <li>Nerdiness
    <li>Gender
</ul>
<p>
    A bunch of these things will, of course, spill over onto other pages, but an introduction is below.

<h2>Gaming</h2>
<p>
    I'm a gamer, both video and tabletop.
</p>

<h3>Video Games</h3>
<p>
    Most of my video gaming is done on my desktop. Visual novels, story-heavy games, and strategy games are my
    favourites, but I play a large variety. I rarely play multiplayer, but if you find me on steam I am sometimes up for
    multiplayer gaming with people I know.
</p>

<p>
    If you have a similar taste to me, here's a small list of recommendations:
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://vndb.org/v3">Utawarerumono</a> - a strategy game mixed with a visual novel.
        <li><a href="https://vndb.org/v14112">Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius</a> and the sequel <a href="https://vndb.org/v17694">
        Sunrider: Liberation Day</a> - also a strategy game mixed with a visual novel, set in space!
        <li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/300550/Shadowrun_Dragonfall__Directors_Cut/">Shadowrun: Dragonfall</a>
        and the other games in the same series - roleplaying games set in the Shadowrun universe.
        <li><a href="http://www.frozensynapse.com">Frozen Synapse</a> - the purest strategy game I've come across.
        <li><a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/">Kerbal Space Program</a> - building spaceships!
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    I also play a fair bit on the PS4, but mostly on whatever free games I get through PS+.

<h3>Tabletop Gaming</h3>
<p>
    I play a lot of board, card and roleplaying games on the tabletop. You can find my BoardGameGeek profile <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/user/TTIOttio">
    here</a>. In terms of board and card games, I lean mostly towards Euro style games, but I'm open to a wide variety.
</p>
<p>
    My true love in tabletop gaming is roleplaying games. My collection of roleplaying games is massive, and I've
    written my own scenarios and systems. I lean towards narrative systems, but I have a habit of writing gamist ones.
</p>

<h2>Nerdiness</h2>
<p>
    I am a massive nerd, both in computing and general nerd culture.
</p>

<h2>Gender</h2>
<p>
    I identify as genderfluid and non-binary. This means that how much of me is male and how much is female varies over
    time, and I never identify fully as either male or female. I strongly prefer that people use gender-neutral
    pronouns when referring to me.
</p>
<img src="img/genderfluid.png" alt="Gender graph">
<p class="caption">The sine wave represents how male I am. 100% is fully male, and 0% is fully female. Of course, in
reality it isn't so simple, but this is a good approximation most of the time.</p>
