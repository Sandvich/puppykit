<h1>Marked For Death</h1>
<p>
    Marked For Death is a game made by myself (Sanchit Sharma) and published by <a href="http://www.shadesofvengeance.com/markedfordeath/">Shades of Vengeance</a>.
    I know that some people struggle with the animated titles below, so click on either of them to turn them into normal
    text.
</p>

<h2><img src="/img/mfd_game.gif" alt="The Game" style="margin-left:0em;" class="animated"></h2>
<p>
    Marked for Death is a (moderately comedic) FATE module about assassins and their contracts. Featuring:
</p>
<ul style="margin-top:-0.5em;">
    <li>Fireballs and other magic!</li>
    <li>High-value targets!</li>
    <li>A total lack of choice in who you kill!</li>
    <li>Oh so many total party kills!</li>
    <li>And did I mention fireballs?</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Want to take down your target with magic? Long distance with a bow? Up close and personal? It's your choice!
</p>

<h2><img src="/img/mfd_rules.gif" alt="The Rules" style="margin-left:0em;" class="animated"></h2>
<p>
    The game expands upon the Fate core rules, aiming to make the game more difficult than Fate as-written. The system
    penalises players for trying to take all the spotlight for themselves, encouraging them to work as a team, and the
    consequences for not doing so are often deadly!<br>
    Of course, deadly consequences can also ensue if they do... But those are the ones the players are hoping for!

<p>
    There are also three GM aids in the book to help co-ordinate games:
</p>
<ul style="margin-top:-0.5em;">
    <li>Reaction Points to help manage global awareness of the team.</li>
    <li>Mook Creation to allow enemies to be created on the fly.</li>
    <li>Squad Combat to streamline large combats.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    One of the Kickstarter rewards was a short campaign written by myself. I'm now releasing this campaign for free
    online, as it has been enough time since the Kickstarter to give the backers that paid for it their value. If you
    like, you can download the campaign below to give you a five-session introduction to the system and what it can do.
