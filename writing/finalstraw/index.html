<h1>The Final Straw</h1>
<h2>Background - The Pack</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Serra:</dt>
    <dd>Indian she-wolf that was forced to move when her home government declared her a terrorist. Vehicle rigger.
        Officially inside the pack, but doesn’t have as close a connection as the others.</dd>
    <dt>Accalia and Dwam:</dt>
    <dd>German-born female and male alphas respectively. Neither are combat-oriented. Accalia doesn’t engage in the
        shadowrunning side of things, preferring instead to stay behind and look after those who need it. Dwam leads the
        pack in shadowrunning activities and social interactions, heading up one of the two teams, whilst Accalia tends
        to handle logistics and care. Mated to one another.</dd>
    <dt>Chinua and Larentia:</dt>
    <dd>Twin Italian she-wolves that wandered Europe for a few years after fleeing their home. Both deckers, unmated.</dd>
    <dt>Fenris:</dt>
    <dd>Swedish he-wolf that escaped to Berlin after a run gone wrong. Has anger issues, and makes good use of these in
        combat situations. Mated to Ula.</dd>
    <dt>Ula:</dt>
    <dd>French she-wolf who moved to Berlin after she lost control of a spirit who proceeded to burn down her home
        neighbourhood. Shaman, beta, third in command after Dwam and Accalia. Mated to Fenris.</dd>
    <dt>Sindari:</dt>
    <dd>Chinese she-wolf that was captured by MCT for cyber-experimentation and rescued by the pack a few years back.
        Feral and quite insane. Unmated, and likely unable to consent anyway.</dd>
    <dt>Honi:</dt>
    <dd>Native American she-wolf who moved to Europe after pissing off large amounts of her tribe due to her insistence
        on using technology and her aggressive and slightly feral nature. Drone rigger, mated to Roukan.</dd>
    <dt>Roukan:</dt>
    <dd>Japanese he-wolf, ex-corporate. Fled Japan when his shifter nature was discovered. Wandered North America for a
        while before meeting Honi online and following her to Berlin. Has an eye for detail and a spirit dog named Shi.
        Mated to Honi.</dd>
    <dt>Chantelou:</dt>
    <dd>French she-wolf, ex-military. Moved to Berlin after her squadron was disbanded following French attacks on
        corporate holdings in the SOX. Shaman, beta, unmated.</dd>
    <dt>Gunnolf:</dt>
    <dd>German he-wolf who grew up with Dwam. One of the earliest members of the pack aside from Dwam and Accalia.
        Sniper, unmated.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>The Final Straw</h2>
<p>I carefully park my motorbike, chaining it to a nearby tree, before entering the relative peace of the forest. Here,
    in central Berlin, is probably the last place people would expect to find a wolf pack. That’s why we thrive. I
    carefully remove my equipment and clothes, stashing them in a tree hollowed out specifically for this purpose. Each
    of us have a few hiding spots like this. Once I am free of the restrictive clothing I transform, taking on my real,
    lupine, form.</p>
<p>The colours around me dull, but I can suddenly smell and hear things that I couldn’t in my human body. The soft
    rustle of the leaves as the wind flows over them, the earthy, homely smell of our forest fill my senses. That mark
    on the tree over there is no longer obviously sap or blood by sight but… Sniffing and noticing the lack of a
    metallic tang in the air, it is quite obviously sap.</p>
<p>The whole situation weighs heavily on my mind. I remember the first time I worked with Liz. Things had been so much
    better then...</p>
<p class="center">...oooOOOooo...</p>
<p>I’m gliding slowly over an arcology. Drones are strange devices - they have no sense of smell and rely far too
    heavily on visuals. Still, this one has directional hearing, like my real body. Kutta, my helicopter, is nearby,
    drowning out my own engines, and I can just about catch a glimpse of myself as I peer inside his cockpit. The wolf
    apparently sleeping on a seat is just barely visible from out here.</p>
<p>“Ready.” I hear Liz’s voice over my comms as she flies away from my drone body, having finished her preparations.
    I’m now invisible, protected from magic, and I can call on her to provide any additional manoeuvrability if I need
    to. I hope I won’t need to.</p>
<p>That’s another thing about drones - they don’t have tails. Well, this one sorta does. I wag it slightly, the movement
    causing my body to yaw from left to right. Note to self: rudders are not tails.</p>
<p>I start to climb, turning off my engines partway through. It isn’t long before I reach stall speed, but I was
    expecting that. It just makes the ride sweeter. I dive.</p>
<p>For a few brief seconds I am not a wolf remotely controlling a flying drone. I am a bird, soaring out of reach. Then
    reality kicks back in as radiation starts to corrupt the data stream from the drone. Well, at least we expected the
    damaged reactor to affect us. It wasn't a surprise. Visuals are messed up, my accelerometer occasionally shows
    strange readings, my compass is all over the place. Tch, damn reality. Always getting in the way of my fun.</p>
<p>It gets worse the closer I get to the reactor core, so I cut the dive and climb away a little, increasing my throttle
    as I do so. I can see more clearly from here. After a few seconds, I spot my target.</p>
<p>“Sighted. A human and a badger. I’ll get both, just in case." I’m communicating entirely through text - it’s just
    easier when I’m jumped in. Liz will probably be slower to react, but we both know this.</p>
<p>I hear no reply as I line up my attack run, deliberately facing the wrong direction. When I’m ready, I pull up and
    stall again. This time I use my rudder properly, turning myself on the spot as I slow - a perfectly executed
    Immelmann turn. I dive once more.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount turrets make a lot of sense for a plane-like drone, such as the one I’m currently piloting. They make
    things a little harder though. Still, I am pointed precisely at my target, and I fire off a burst of rounds - the
    badger dies without even knowing what hit it, and the human fares little better. I pull up to deliver my coup de
    grâce; my cargo bay opens and a frag grenade lands a mere 8m from him. He explodes seconds later. I search through
    my collection of air force quotes, and deliver a “Target down!” to Liz. That was too easy.</p>
<p>Although slightly damaged from the stress of pulling up at such a high speed and a small amount of shrapnel, I survey
    the area to provide a detailed report for our Johnson before returning to Kutta. When I approach the helicopter Liz
    slows me down, far faster than I could ever do so by myself, and lands me quite comfortably inside.</p>
<p>I disconnect from the drone, and open my eyes.</p>
<p class="center">...oooOOOooo...</p>
<p>Things were different back then. Things were good.</p>
<p>I growl the passphrase as I walk deeper into the forest. The scent of vegetation fills my nostrils. I can faintly
    smell magic in the background. This forest is differently scented to most, of course, even ignoring the smell of the
    pack there is a distinct absence of prey. They moved out pretty quickly when we arrived. Those that stayed got what
    they deserved for staying around twelve adult wolves.</p>
<p>Small sticks crunch softly beneath my paws as I pad forwards. Other than the wind and my footsteps there is almost no
    sound.</p>
<p>For once though, this is not a happy return to my family. I can feel a pit in my stomach as I walk, it getting harder
    with every step I take. I’m going to have to give them an ultimatum. I can’t force them to move, of course, but I
    have enough authority to ensure a vote. Maybe enough will trust me to follow.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe not. Then I’d have to leave on my own. I’m not sure I would be able to cope with that. I push back
    the thought and keep moving.</p>
<p>Pretty soon the scent of my family is strong enough to distinguish individuals. Ula is strongest right now - she must
    be on scouting duty. Most likely one of her watcher spirits spotted me the moment I entered the forest. This is why
    Ula and Chantelou tend to do the scouting most often, despite it being a menial chore not normally given to betas.
    Simply put, they are the best equipped to do it. One of the many ways in which my pack is unorthodox.</p>
<p>Still, Ula was nearby. That was good. She would help me get my thoughts in order. Help to soothe my frazzled mind.</p>
<p class="center">...oooOOOooo...</p>
<p>“Good holiday, mon amie?” The voice comes from my left, as expected.<br>
    “Hah. With Liz around, what do you expect?”<br>
    “I can imagine.” We walk together for a bit, neither looking at the other but nevertheless comfortably aware of one
    another.<br>
    “Ula,” I begin. I pause for a moment to gather my thoughts. “I need your help.”</p>
<p>She stops to nibble on my fur, purring softly. This is just one of many reasons that all French people are insane.
    <em>Wolves aren’t meant to purr!</em><br>
    “What do you need, cherie?”<br>
    “You see… Liz has gone too far this time. She’s endangered all of us. I thought I could keep her in check, but...
    I’ve failed.” Ula sits, encouraging me to do the same.<br>
    “Talk to me.”<br>
    “You remember her dumb plan to flee the Earth?”<br>
    “Abandoning everyone here and her place of birth, yes…” Ula growls softly at the thought. None of us are happy with
    the idea of abandoning the planet, no matter how dire the circumstances.<br>
    “She decided to find this guy, Miyazagi, who’s apparently some great spaceship engineer. Only problem, he was
    infected with some weird disease that allows an AI to take over a metahuman body. The AI in question… Was Deus.
    He escaped, and may have infected others.”<br>
    “I see.” Ula being a shaman, I’m initially uncertain of whether she understands the potential consequences. However,
    true to form, worry immediately crosses her face. Being a beta, she keeps up with world events, and apparently she
    has heard of Deus before.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I tried to keep her from doing anything stupid, but I didn’t know until it was too late… I think we might
    need to act.”<br>
    “What do you propose we do? We can hardly contain this Deus by ourselves.”<br>
    “You’re right, but we know someone practically on our doorstop who can. I’m proposing that we move to Essen.”</p>
<p>Ula doesn’t react at first. She merely sits, thinking. It’s only now that I notice that she dropped the French a
    while back - something she only does when her normal, playful attitude isn’t appropriate. Her ears twitch slightly.</p>
<p>I consider Liz again, whilst Ula thinks. That last visit, the first time she saw my home, is one I'd like to forget.</p>
<p class="center">...oooOOOooo...</p>
<p>The world is spinning. My pack seem to be… Running around me? I can definitely smell Gunnolf and Fenrir moving
    around me, but they’re not running. They seem to be sitting.</p>
<p>“Guys, stop doing that…”<br>
    “Serra, you’re drunk.”<br>
    “Whaaa? Shaddup Fenriiii, I’m not-” Wait. Maybe I am drunk. I don’t normally talk like that.<br>
    “How comesh I’m drunk?”<br>
    Gunnolf sighs. “Don’t you remember? You drank a whole bottle of rum in two hours.” He looks over to Fenrir. “Do we
    have to look after her?”<br>
    “Would you really leave a packmate behind?”<br>
    Gunnolf mutters under his breath. “Barely a packmate.” But I hear him.<br>
    “Heyyyy! I heard that! Don’t be meeaaaan, I know you luff me really!”</p>
<p>I often gave him a hard time, but now that I think about it, Gunnolf is actually pretty hot. I start to lick his ear
    playfully, but he pushes me away. I do my best puppy eyes.</p>
<p>“Serra, I’m not gonna fuck you when you’re sober. Don’t come onto me when you’re drunk.” Clearly the puppy eyes
    weren’t working. Time for a new tack. He likes humans, right? Maybe I could shift back to my human form and…</p>
<p>Before I get the chance to finish my thought, the other two perk up. They sniff the air together. I do the same when
    I realise what they’re doing, and notice a new scent. A bit like… My pack? But my pack are here. What’s going on?
    Cogs turn in my head, and then I realise.</p>
<p>“Ohmygod people made clones of you guys and they’re attacking us!”<br>
    “Shut up, Serra.” Gunnolf cuts in.<br>
    “They’re gonna kill us and take our pl-” Gunnolf bites my mouth to stop me yelling. The fact that this is how
    humans show love crosses my mind, but the anger coming off him advises me to keep quiet.<br>
    “I believe they are your friends, Serra. Those metahumans you run with.” Fenrir is a voice of reason. But I don’t
    want reason right now.<br>
    “You guys are boring.” My growl is muffled due to Gunnolf.<br>
    “Serra. You probably want to take human form in order to meet them. I’ll get you some clothes. Gunnolf, let her
    go.” He does so reluctantly as Fenrir disappears for a few moments.</p>
<p>After some pestering, I shift back into human form and get dressed. This is uncomfortable. I can smell my friends
    now though, so it’s probably for the best.</p>
<p>Ergh. Why did they have to come over? Didn’t I make it clear that I didn’t want to see them right now? Pretty sure
    I’ve been ignoring them for a few hours or something. But here they are. The distinctly magical smell of Liz, the
    young and energetic smell of Echo, the distinctly somewhat elf and somewhat orc but very expensive smell of Kaz and
    the vague weed smell of Redline. They’re all here. Oh, and that robot Echo sits on a lot.</p>
<p>Actually, maybe the weed is me. I think I have some around here. Yeah, it’s actually probably me. What was I doing
    again?</p>
<p>Then they enter the clearing, led by Roukan. And all of my pack seem to have turned up as well - I guess to greet
    the newcomers? I see Chinua and start licking her face as the rest of the pack sort things out. I don’t really want
    to deal with these people right now.</p>
