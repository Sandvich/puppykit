# Puppykit
A repo for my website, [www.puppykit.org.uk](www.puppykit.org.uk)

Static, mostly a portfolio. Written almost entirely from scratch, using a small amount of JQuery and Pure CSS to make my
life a little easier.  
The CSS and HTML for the navbar are from Pure's example [navbar](https://purecss.io/layouts/tucked-menu-vertical/).

## Contributing

Please feel free to contribute! For the most part, these things are related to me and therefore won't be appropriate for other people to correct, but on occasion that won't be the case.

Feel free to open issues or pull requests (request against the `corrections` branch, as that is where changes are staged until I'm ready to release them. `master` always represents the current state of the deployed code.)
