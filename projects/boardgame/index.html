<h1>Unnamed Board Game</h1>
<p>
    This is a planned board game set in a cyberpunk universe. It will be a competitive game about cracking.
</p>
<h2 class="status not-started">Not Started</h2>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>
    Players will have a hand of cards which they can use to build attack programs. They will then send these programs to
    attack various targets, rewarding them with cash and penalising them with notoriety. They can use this cash to buy
    program upgrades and to reduce their notoriety. When the endgame arrives, the player with the most cash will win.
</p>
<p> Unlike most games of this style, the players have no ability to control the programs once they unleash them -
    cyberspace is too fast for humans to respond in the way that people do in most cyberpunk settings!
</p>
<p>
    Very little about this game is concrete at this stage, and the project itself is low priority, so I don't know when
    it will be completed.
