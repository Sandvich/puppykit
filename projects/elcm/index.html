<h1>ELCM</h1>
<p>
    ELCM, or ELCM Living Campaign Manager, is a project intended to condense the current mix of systems that most living
    campaigns use to manage their data and condense it into a single system. Any given campaign will still need to host
    their own instance of the project, but it should make life much simpler.

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
    Our plan is for players to be able to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Choose which mission they want to play before a session begins.</li>
    <li>Keep track of their contacts (including the other players).</li>
    <li>Receive character rewards privately - in case they screwed someone else over!</li>
    <li>Track resources spent, such as downtime, karma, nuyen, gold etc.</li>
    <li>Upload a character bio and image.</li>
</ul>

<p>And for GMs to be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create missions.</li>
    <li>Create NPC bios.</li>
    <li>Assign characters to PCs as contacts.</li>
    <li>Upload documents, handout style.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Having played in Shadownet, myself and a few others saw the need for a system like this. We decided to work together
    on this project, my part being largely to do with environment and reproducibility.<br>
