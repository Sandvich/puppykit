<h1>Mystic Empyrean Traits</h1>
<p>
    Empyrean Traits is a small program designed to help players of the role-playing game <a href="http://www.mysticempyrean.com">Mystic Empyrean</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="status in-progress">Status: In Progress</h2>

<h2>Traits</h2>
<p>
    Mystic Empyrean is one of my favourite roleplaying games. The only thing that I dislike about it is the difficulty
    of using the trait system. Looking through a long list of keywords to find the exact thing that you want is a pain,
    especially if there's only one book and multiple people are trying to do this at the same time.
</p>
<p>
    To combat this problem, I decided to employ a fairly basic solution - I copied up all of the traits into a
    spreadsheet which I could then use to look up traits more easily. In order to get this working with the UI remaining
    consistent, I had to make use of macros - obviously a far from perfect solution. Still, this did work. If you're
    interested, you can download the (no longer maintained) spreadsheet <a href="/files/empyrean.ods">here</a> - note:
    it will not work properly in Microsoft Excel, but will work in all spreadsheet applications which support the ODS
    standard.
</p>
<p>
    After this, I began work on a solution built in Python. Although Tkinter (the default python GUI toolkit) isn't the
    prettiest, it does the job and allowed me to get the core logic in place. This resulted in a much more useful
    program, but one that would need to be run on a developers' machine in pretty much all situations... This version is
    no longer in development, but is the latest version of the project. You can get it <a href="https://github.com/Sandvich/MysticEmpyrean">here</a>.

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
    In the future, I want to move the application to C++/QT5. This will not only result in a much prettier program, but
    will allow me to distribute binaries instead of users needing to download python and any packages that I need. I may
    skip this step and go straight to the webapp, however.<br>
    My feature wishlist includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Search by trait name, type, or personality type</li>
    <li>Suggest similar traits</li>
    <li>Android/iOS/web apps</li>
</ul>
