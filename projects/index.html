<h1>Info about my projects</h1>
<p>
    Below is information about a number of projects that I've worked on.
</p>

<h2>Gaming</h2>
<h3><a href="https://longestegg.itch.io/ghost">Ghost</a></h3>
<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/62584?dark=true" width="552" height="167"></iframe>
<p><a href="https://github.com/avivbeeri/GameJam">Source code</a></p>
<p>
    We'd like to keep working on this, but for now the LowRezJam release is where we're leaving it. We may pick it up
    again one day.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://ttio.itch.io/physsim">PhysSim</a></h3>
<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/105887?dark=true" width="552" height="167"></iframe>
<p>
    This was a project to help me learn how to use the Godot engine. I'm not going to be adding any more to this.
</p>

<h3><a href="/projects/accalia/">The Accalia</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Sandvich/ship-scroller">Source Code</a></p>
<p>
    My current active coding project (aside from this website). This is hopefully going to be a lot bigger than the
    other two video game projects I worked on. I have a detailed plan for it, but can't work on it as much as I would
    like due to time constraints. No Itch.IO page yet, but watch this space!
</p>

<h3><a href="/projects/marked_for_death.html">Marked For Death</a></h3>
<p>
    A Fate module written by myself and published by Shades of Vengeance. There was more I was planning to do with this,
    but I don't like the system anymore. I think I made it too complex. I'm quite proud of the campaign and universe I
    wrote though, so if you're interested, check it out!
</p>

<h3><a href="projects/boardgame/">Unnamed Board Game</a></h3>
<p>
    <em>Note: This is in the very early stages of planning.</em><br>I am developing a board game about cracking -
    set in a cyberpunk universe the players assemble attack programs to steal valuables from their targets.
</p>
<p>
    For extra nerd cred, I plan to write the rulebook in C++/Markdown.
</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>
    <h3><a href="/index.html">PuppyKit</a></h3>
<p>
    This website! See my homepage for more details.
</p>

<h3><a href="/projects/runners/">Runner's Hub</a></h3>
<p>
    A small website to help maintain a Shadowrun runner's hub. This will go live on http://runners.puppykit.org.uk in
    the future.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/Sandvich/MysticEmpyrean">Empyrean Traits</a></h3>
<p>
    A small tool to help players of the game Mystic Empyrean look up traits. This may eventually change into a QT/C++
    program to increase portability, and if I ever learn Android programming I'll be making an app for it too. For now
    though, what you see is what you get.
