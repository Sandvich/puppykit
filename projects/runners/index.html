<h1>Runners' Hub</h1>
<p>
    The Runners' Hub is a small dynamic website to help co-ordinate a Dungeons and Dragons Organised Play -
    style Shadowrun campaign.
</p>
<h2 class="status not-started">Not Started</h2>

<h2>Aim</h2>
<p>
    The goal is to run a campaign at Imperial College London which will function in a similar way to Dungeons and
    Dragons Organised Play. Each session, a number of players turn up with characters that they've been playing for the
    entire campaign. They group themselves into teams, play a mission in a self-consistent universe, and get rewards.
</p>

<p>
    I aim for the site to allow players to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Choose which mission they want to play before a session begins.</li>
    <li>Keep track of their contacts (including the other players).</li>
    <li>Receive character rewards privately - in case they screwed someone else over!</li>
    <li>Track downtime, karma and nuyen spent.</li>
    <li>Upload a character bio and image.</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, GMs will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create missions.</li>
    <li>Create NPC bios.</li>
    <li>Assign characters to PCs as contacts (by setting Connection and Loyalty).</li>
    <li>Upload documents, handout style.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    It's my hope that this will streamline the process of playing a relatively complex campaign. I'm working on this
    with BÃ¡lint Babik, a Computing undergraduate at Imperial College London.
